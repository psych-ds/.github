## üõ†Ô∏è Core Repositories

### [psych-ds](https://github.com/psych-ds/psych-ds) (Schema Model)
This repository contains the LinkML schema model that defines all objects, rules, fields, and validation criteria for Psych-DS compliant datasets. The schema model is also used to automatically generate reference materials within our documentation.

### [psychds-validator](https://github.com/psych-ds/psychds-validator) (CLI Validator)
Our Deno-based JavaScript validator that implements the Psych-DS schema. It can be used:
- As a command-line tool
- As an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/psychds-validator)
- In a bundled form for client-side validation

### [psychds-validator-web](https://github.com/psych-ds/psychds-validator-web) (Web Validator)
A user-friendly web interface for the validator, built with [Deno Fresh](https://github.com/denoland/fresh). Features include:
- Interactive dataset validation
- Detailed feedback and troubleshooting for errors, warnings, and best practices
- No file uploads required, all validation is done within the browser
